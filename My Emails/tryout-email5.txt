Hello All, 

1) JV tourney opportunity this Saturday:  We have been given the opportunity to go to a JV tournament this Saturday (for free).  If you know that you can make it, let me know as soon as you can.  I would also take C team players if JV players cannot, so please C team players check as well.  The games are at 9, 11, and 1 in SSP and we would have a bus.  I have attached a flyer with some information.  We would be taking the place of Highland.  I hope we can go! 

2) Turn in fundraising money if you haven't already!!!!

3) May 18th: I have rescheduled some of the tournament games for this day.  JV/V will each get two games, and C will not have a game this day.  We will run concessions again, so please take a look at the google doc again and make any edits:  Concessions sign up 

And here is the game schedule for May 18th: 
West Field	East Field	South Field
11:00	St. Agnes vs. Central (JV)	SLP vs. SW (V)	
1:00	SLP vs. Central (JV)	St. Agnes vs. Central (V)	SW vs. St. Agnes (JV)
2:30	SW v SLP (JV)	St. Agnes vs. SW (V)	SLP vs. Central (V)
SLP = Spring Lake Park		
SW = Southwest 		

4) Banquet June 2nd, 6:30 p.m. at Degidios.  A google doc sign up is coming soon.

Thanks,

Coach Lodge
