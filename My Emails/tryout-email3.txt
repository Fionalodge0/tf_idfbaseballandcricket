Hello All, 

Tryouts are over, thank you for your hard work!  We had 52 girls at tryouts and had to make some very difficult decisions.  If you have changed your mind about playing this year, Friday is the last day to get a refund from the athletic director.  

This Thursday, uniforms will be handed out at 2:15 at the equipment room, and you will also get your athletic locker room.

Next Wednesday, March 27th, several events are happening:
 Our fundraising event will happen from 2:30-4:00 in a classroom (TBD).  Athletes will receive more information about this tomorrow.
The pizza party will happen directly afterwards celebrating our excellent turnout at tryouts.
The parent meeting will happen from 5:00-5:30, in the same classroom.
Thank you!
