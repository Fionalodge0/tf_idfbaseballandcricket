Hello All,

The game today against Johnson has been postponed.  If I forget to tell you when it is rescheduled for, a reminder that you can always check the site:  Game Schedule .  JV/C you will have Jimmy Lee from 2:30-3:30, and V will go from 3:30-4:30.  JV/C let me know what equipment you want me to pick up from Dunning.

I have been able to reschedule 2 of the tournament games to May 18th, and we will do concessions at that time, so please save your purchases if you have them.  I am hoping to have the details for the game schedule/etc available in a couple days at most.  We will keep the same document, so feel free to edit that as well.

Other:  Please save the date for the banquet as June 2nd at Degidios, 6:30.

RBI team:  I will be confirming players for this team very soon, and parents you may get a call from me confirming that your athlete is able to commit.  My number is a (218) number, so just a heads up!  

Thanks,

Coach Lodge
