Hello All,

Fundraising: I am still missing some fundraising money from some of you.  Please get this to me ASAP!

May 18th: Please remember to fill out/adjust the volunteer form for May 18th at the following link: May 18th volunteering.  
Any C team player that volunteers will get one free guest banquet ticket!  You will also get free food from the concessions stand. 

Photos:Varsity Photos, see below.  If anyone else has photos, let me know and I can share them, otherwise we will use them at the banquet!

Playoffs: Also, I have attached the Varsity playoff schedule.  Please note that there are some Saturday 'in case of rain' dates.  We will not know who we play until May 19th, and the first game is May 21.

C team's last game is May 16 and JV is May 18th, where did the time go?

Onward!
