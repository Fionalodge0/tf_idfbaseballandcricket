Hi All, 

Attached again is the information for the JV tournament.  The bus leaves from Central at 7:20, so do whatever you gotta do to get there on time.  We will have some breakfast snacks available.  There will also be a concession stand for food between games, so bring some loose change, and I will also bring some if you forget.  The games are at 9, 11, 1.  

The address is:  
The Kaposia Landing Athletic Complex

800  Bryant  Ave

South St Paul, MN 55075



I have the following players confirmed: Andrea, Ella I, Vida, Payeng, Lucy, MC, Keira (1st 2 games only), Ava (1st 2 games only), Maddie, Deeqa, Ella VG, Tiffany, Naya, Abbie



Thanks for making this work!  I am glad we could get the JV some more games!
