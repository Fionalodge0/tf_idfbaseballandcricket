Hello All, 

A few things.  

1. It is getting nice outside which means we may be able to get on the turf soon.  However, I will not know whether we can get on the turf until the day of.  This means that players need to start packing outdoor wear (pants, long sleeves, jackets, etc..).  We can use tennis shoes or plastic cleats on the turf (not metal).

2. I have attached the game schedule with appropriate levels.  Take note that some of it has changed since I handed it out at the pre-season meeting.

3. Fundraising Notes:
The essence of this fundraiser is that athletes spend an hour (on Wednesday) calling people to sell popcorn to raise funds.  We are competing against the baseball team to see who can sell the most per person.  
Students have a contact sheet to fill out with names and numbers of people who may buy popcorn. They need to fill this out and return it to me or their coach by Monday or Tuesday.  This is all they need to do with it at this time.  The sheet asked for 50 names and numbers but do your best.
After this, it is the students responsibility to collect the funds and distribute the popcorn.  There is also a way for buyers to pay online.
If you are not interested in the fundraising activity, you can also donate (greater than or equal to) 20 dollars.
If your athlete skips out on fundraising or a donation, they will sit for a full game.  
Our fundraising this year is going towards our pitching coach (coach McGrath) and the banquet.  
4.  On Tuesday, I will clean up this email list, as I know some of you are receiving these emails but are not playing.

Thanks.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Sorry for yet (another) long email!
