Hello All, 

1.) As a reminder, your forms/payment are due on Friday.  Remember, if we get 33 players in the first two days, we get a food party.  

2.) Some of you have been very proactive about communicating with me regarding conflicts in your schedule.  I really appreciate that.  If you have a schedule conflict during tryouts/season, early communication is best!  I can even stop by school in the next couple of days to talk about it if need be.

3.) Here is the tryout schedule, all located in the Jimmy Lee (aka Oxford Rec) fieldhouse. Monday has been revised slightly for the pitchers and catchers meeting.  I would appreciate it if you can get there as soon as you can for tryouts, as it takes some time to check in.  Also, please bring a water bottle in addition to your glove and workout clothes.  

4.) Note, Tuesday is an ACT day and is also a tryout evaluation day.  If you do not go to school that day, you will want to find transportation to tryouts.  

Monday, March 11:
2:30-4:15  Returning C team and new players
4:15-4:20  Pitchers and Catchers meeting
3:45-5:30  Returning JV/V

Tuesday - Thursday:
2:30-4:30 All (including pitchers and catchers)
4:30-5:30 Pitchers and Catchers

Friday:
TBD depending on where we are with team selections.  

Thanks,

Coach Lodge
