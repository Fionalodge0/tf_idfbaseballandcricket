Hello All,

If you missed the meeting on Thursday, make sure you pick up your eligibility forms from the Athletic Office as soon as you can.  The forms are due the Friday before tryouts (March 8th).  

I have also attached the notes and schedule that I gave out at the meeting, please let me know if you have any questions regarding those.  Spring is a very busy time of year, so please look through the schedule in order to avoid as many conflicts as possible. Also, note that the schedule attached is the varsity schedule, the JV/C schedule will contain less games once we find out how many teams our competitors have.  

Also, below is the tryouts schedule (all will be in the Oxford Recreational Fieldhouse, a.k.a. Jimmy Lee).  Please plan to arrive early (10-15) minutes before to check in.  It will be helpful if you get there as early as you can this week, as it takes awhile to check everyone in.  

Monday, March 11:
2:30-4:15  Returning C team and new players
3:45-5:20  Returning JV/V
5:20-5:30  Pitchers and catchers meeting

Tuesday - Thursday:
2:30-4:30 All (including pitchers and catchers)
4:30-5:30 Pitchers and Catchers

Friday:
TBD depending on where we are with team selections.  

Thanks everyone!  Other information to follow later will include more details on the schedule/parent meeting/uniforms.
