Hello All,

The game is postponed and rescheduled for May 17th (this was the only date left available!).  All levels have a well deserved day off from practice today.

The banquet sheet is up and running, please edit your information in the google document:  Banquet sign up .  The latest you can inform me if you are attending the banquet will be May 17th.  Our fundraising is not done yet, but my best guess on price is students & kids (0-10) and parents (20-30).  Unfortunately, we did not raise as much as we did last year through our fundraiser so students may have to pitch in this year.  

Please bring your fundraising money to me at practice tomorrow! 

Thanks,

Coach Lodge
