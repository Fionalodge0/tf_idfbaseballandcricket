'''Hockey''' is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a [[Hockey puck|puck]] into the opponent's goal using a [[hockey stick]]. There are many types of hockey such as [[bandy]], [[field hockey]], and [[ice hockey]].

In most of the world, hockey refers to [[field hockey]], while in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Latvia]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], hockey usually refers to  [[ice hockey]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Liebeck|editor1-first=Elaine|editor2-last=Pollard|editor2-first=Helen|title=The Oxford Paperback Dictionary|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0-19-280012-4|edition=4th}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The first recorded use of the word ''hockey'' is in the 1773 book ''Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education'' by Richard Johnson (Pseud. Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled "New Improvements on the Game of Hockey".{{sfn|Gidén|Houda|Martel|2014|p=50}} The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by [[Edward III of England|King Edward III of England]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records 2015 |date=2014 |publisher=Guinness World Records |isbn=9781908843821 |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUaHBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT218&pg=PT218 |language=en}}</ref> is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games "Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rymer |first1=Thomas |title=Foedera, conventiones, literae, et cujuscumque generis acta publica, inter reges Angliae, et alios quosvis imperatores, reges, pontifices ab anno 1101 |date=1740 |at=Book 3, part 2, p. 79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=La2HrCHbd9AC&pg=RA1-PA79}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Sir James Sibbald David |title=The British Army: Its Origin, Progress, and Equipment |date=1868 |publisher=Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Company |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pa6wJujkenUC&pg=PA86 |language=en}}</ref> The English historian and biographer [[John Strype]] did not use the word "hockey" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating "Canibucam" as "Cambuck";<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strype |first1=John |title=Survey of London |date=1720 |url=https://www.dhi.ac.uk/strype/TransformServlet?page=book1_251&display=normal |at=Book 1, pp. 250-251 |language=en}}</ref> this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birley |first1=Derek |title=Sport and the Making of Britain |date=1993 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=9780719037597 |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVQiOYkBvV8C&pg=PA36 |language=en}}</ref>

The word ''hockey'' itself is of unknown origin. One supposition is that it is a derivative of ''hoquet'', a [[Middle French]] word for a [[Shepherd's crook|shepherd's stave]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hockey&searchmode=none |title=Hockey |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref> The curved, or "hooked" ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves. Another supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs, (stoppers) in place of wooden balls to play the game. The stoppers came from barrels containing "hock" ale, also called "hocky".{{sfn|Gidén|Houda|Martel|2014|p=235}}

==History==
[[File:Antiek hockey.JPG|thumb|''bas relief'' approx. 600 BC, in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]]

Games played with [[Hockey stick|curved sticks]] and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures. In Egypt, 4000-year-old carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, [[hurling]] dates to before 1272 BC in [[Ireland]], and there is a depiction from approximately 600 BC in [[Ancient Greece]], where the game may have been called ''keretízein'' or (?e??t??e??) because it was played with a horn or horn-like stick (''kéras'', ???a?).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://hellenisteukontos.blogspot.com/2010/03/ancient-greek-field-hockey.html |first=G. |last=Oikonomos |title=?e??t????te? |publisher=Archaiologikon Deltion |volume=6 |year=1920 |pages=56–59 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref> In [[Inner Mongolia]], the [[Daur people]] have been playing ''[[beikou]]'', a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/sports/olympics/23hockey.html|title=A Chinese Hinterland, Fertile with Field Hockey|last=McGrath|first=Charles|date=August 22, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>

Most evidence of hockey-like games during the [[Middle Ages]] is found in legislation concerning sports and games. The [[Galway]] Statute enacted in Ireland in 1527 banned certain types of ball games, including games using "hooked" (written "hockie", similar to "hooky") sticks.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVQiOYkBvV8C&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309&dq=galway+statute+%22hooky%22&source=bl&ots=1_yJjnyuUH&sig=r4oxzveAvm5_T8MqyzIxKDxH66E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GL6mU5nFIYSoyASE3ILwDg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=galway%20statute%20%22hooky%22&f=false |first=Derek |last=Birley |title=Sport and the Making of Britain |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1993 |page=309 |accessdate=2014-06-22}}</ref>

By the 19th century, the various forms and divisions of historic games began to differentiate and coalesce into the individual sports defined today. Organizations dedicated to the codification of rules and regulations began to form, and national and international bodies sprang up to manage domestic and international competition.

==Subtypes==
===Bandy===
[[File:Kareby IS-AIK, 13 mars 2015 32.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Bandy game in Sweden.]]
{{Main|Bandy}}
Bandy is played with a [[bandy ball|ball]] on a [[association football pitch|football pitch]]-sized ice arena ([[bandy rink]]), typically outdoors, and with many rules similar to [[association football]]. It is played professionally in Russia and Sweden and is considered a [[national sport]] in Russia. The sport is recognized by the [[IOC]]; its international governing body is the [[Federation of International Bandy]].

Bandy has its roots in England in the 19th century, was originally called "hockey on the ice",<ref name=SBF>{{cite web|url=http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandy-Sverige/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Historikochstatistik/Historiskamilstolpar/Bandyhistoria1875-1919/ |title=Svenska Bandyförbundet, bandyhistoria 1875–1919 |publisher=Iof1.idrottonline.se |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019151140/http://iof1.idrottonline.se/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Bandy-Sverige/SvenskaBandyforbundet/Historikochstatistik/Historiskamilstolpar/Bandyhistoria1875-1919/ |archivedate=19 October 2013}}</ref> and spread from England to other European countries around 1900; a similar Russian sport can also be seen as a predecessor and in Russia, bandy is sometimes called "Russian hockey". [[Bandy World Championship]]s have been played since 1957 and [[Women's Bandy World Championship]]s since 2004. There are national club championships in many countries and the top clubs in the world play in the [[Bandy World Cup]] every year.

=== Field hockey ===
[[File:Field hockey.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Field hockey game at [[Melbourne University]].]]
{{main|Field hockey}}
Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based [[artificial turf]], with a small, hard ball approximately 73&nbsp;mm (2.9&nbsp;in) in diameter. The game is popular among both males and females in many parts of the world, particularly in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and [[Argentina]]. In most countries, the game is played between single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex.

The governing body is the 126-member [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH). Men's field hockey has been played at each [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] since 1908 except for 1912 and 1924, while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic Games since 1980.

Modern [[field hockey stick]]s are constructed of a composite of wood, glass fibre or carbon fibre (sometimes both) and are J-shaped, with a curved hook at the playing end, a flat surface on the playing side and a curved surface on the rear side. All sticks are right-handed – left-handed sticks are not permitted.

While field hockey in its current form appeared in mid-18th century [[England]], primarily in schools, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that it became firmly established. The first club was created in 1849 at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in south-east [[London]]. Field hockey is the [[national sport]] of [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surfindia.com/sports/field-hockey.html |title=Hockey in Pakistan |accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref> It was the national sport of [[India]] until the [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (India)|Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]] declared in August 2012 that India has no national sport.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-02/top-stories/33000002_1_national-game-hockey-team-indian-hockey-federation |title=Hockey is not our national game: Ministry |accessdate=2013-05-03 | work=The Times of India}}</ref>

=== Ice hockey ===
[[File:The Colts applying pressure at the Battalion net.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|Ice hockey game between the [[Barrie Colts]] and the [[Brampton Battalion]] ]]
{{main|Ice hockey}}
[[Ice hockey]] is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice, using a three-inch-diameter (76.2&nbsp;mm) [[Sulfur vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]] disc called a [[hockey puck|puck]]. This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice. The game is played all over North America, Europe and to varying extents in many other countries around the world. It is the most popular sport in [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Slovakia]]. Ice hockey is the national sport of Latvia<ref name="NRA">{{lv icon}} {{Cite web| url= http://www.nra.lv/zinas/27398-nacionalie-sporta-veidi.htm | title= Nacionalie sporta veidi... | accessdate=15 November 2009}}</ref> and the national winter sport of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/n-16.7/page-1.html|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, National Sports of Canada Act|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}</ref> Ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all ages.

The governing body of international play is the 77-member [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF). Men's ice hockey has been played at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924, and was in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. Women's ice hockey was added to the [[1998 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in 1998]]. [[North America]]'s [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic ice hockey over many categories. International ice hockey rules were adopted from Canadian rules in the early 1900s.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}}

The contemporary sport developed in Canada from European and native influences. These included various stick and ball games similar to field hockey, bandy and other games where two teams push a ball or object back and forth with sticks. These were played outdoors on ice under the name "hockey" in England throughout the 19th century, and even earlier under various other names.{{sfn|Gidén|Houda|Martel|2014|p=}} In Canada, there are 24 reports{{sfn|Gidén|Houda|Martel|2014|pp=24, 25, 248}} of hockey-like games in the 19th century before 1875 (five of them using the name "hockey"). The [[First indoor hockey game|first organized and recorded game]] of ice hockey was played indoors in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, on March 3, 1875, and featured several [[McGill University]] students.

[[Ice hockey stick]]s are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, [[graphite#Uses|graphite]], or [[composite materials|composites]] with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can legally curve either way, for [[left-handed|left]]- or [[right-handed]] players.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/biomechanics-ice-hockey-slap-shots-which-stick-best |title=Biomechanics of Ice Hockey Slap Shots: Which Stick Is Best? |last=Laliberte |first=David J. |work=The Sport Journal |issn=1543-9518 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806023625/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/biomechanics-ice-hockey-slap-shots-which-stick-best |archivedate=2009-08-06 |df= }}</ref>

=== Ice sledge hockey ===
{{Main|Ice sledge hockey}}
Ice sledge hockey or para ice hockey is a form of ice hockey designed for players with physical [[disability|disabilities]] affecting their lower bodies. Players sit on double-bladed [[sled]]ges and use two sticks; each stick has a blade at one end and small picks at the other. Players use the sticks to pass, stickhandle and shoot the puck, and to propel their sledges. The rules are very similar to [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] ice hockey rules.<ref>{{cite web | last=International Paralympic Committee | authorlink=International Paralympic Committee | title=Ice Sledge Hockey&nbsp;— Rulebook | url=http://www.paralympic.org/release/Winter_Sports/Ice_Sledge_Hockey/About_the_sport/Rules/ice_sledge_hockey_rulebook.pdf | accessdate=October 11, 2006|format=PDF}}</ref>

Canada is a recognized international leader in the development of sledge hockey, and much of the equipment for the sport was first developed there, such as sledge [[hockey stick]]s laminated with [[fiberglass]], as well as aluminum shafts with hand-carved insert blades and special aluminum sledges with regulation skate blades.

Based on ice sledge hockey, inline sledge hockey is played to the same rules as inline puck hockey (essentially ice hockey played off-ice using inline skates). There is no classification point system dictating who can play inline sledge hockey, unlike the situation with other team sports such as wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. Inline sledge hockey is being developed to allow everyone, regardless of whether they have a disability or not, to complete up to world championship level based solely on talent and ability.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first game of inline sledge hockey was played at Bisley, England, on 19 December 2009 between the Hull Stingrays and the Grimsby Redwings. [[Matt Lloyd, Paralympic Athlete|Matt Lloyd]] is credited with inventing inline sledge hockey, and Great Britain is seen as the international leader in the game's development.

=== Roller hockey (inline) ===
{{main|Roller in-line hockey}}
[[File:Argentin player during 2007 rink hockey world championship.jpg|thumb|right|Rink hockey – Rollhockey – Hoquei em Patins]]
[[Inline hockey]] is a variation of [[roller hockey]] very similar to [[ice hockey]], from which it is derived. Inline hockey is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. The game is played in three 15-minute periods with a variation of the ice hockey off-side rule. Icings are also called, but are usually referred to as illegal clearing.<ref>For rink dimensions and an overview of the rules of the game, see [http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/InLineRuleBook2005.pdf IIHF Inline Rules].</ref> The governing body is the [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]], as for ice hockey, but some leagues and competitions do not follow the IIHF regulations, in particular USA Inline and Canada Inline.

=== Roller hockey (quad) ===
{{main|Roller hockey (quad)}}
Roller hockey, also known as quad hockey, international-style ball hockey, and Hoquei em Patins, is an overarching name for a roller sport that has existed since long before inline skates were invented. This sport is played in over sixty countries and has a worldwide following. Roller hockey was a demonstration sport at the [[Barcelona 1992|1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics]].

=== Street hockey ===
{{main|Street hockey}}
Also known as road hockey, this is a dry-land variant of ice and roller hockey played year-round on a hard surface (usually asphalt). A ball is usually used instead of a puck, and protective equipment is not usually worn.

==Other forms of hockey==
[[File:Mapuche Chueca-Alonso Ovalle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Native [[Mapuche]]s playing [[:es:Palín (juego)|palín]], shown in ''Histórica Relación del Reino de Chile'' by [[Alonso de Ovalle]], Rome, 1646]]
Other games derived from hockey or its predecessors include the following:
[[File:Boxhockey1935.jpg|thumb|Box Hockey being played in Miami, Florida, 1935]]
* [[Air hockey]] is played indoors with a puck on an air-cushion table.
* Beach hockey, a variation of street hockey, is a common sight on [[Southern California]] beaches.
* [[Ball hockey]] is played in a gym using sticks and a ball, often a [[tennis]] ball with the felt removed.
* [[Box hockey]] is a schoolyard game played by two people. The object of the game is to move a hockey puck from the center of the box out through a hole placed at the end of the box (known as the goal). The players kneel facing one another on either side of the box, and each attempts to move the puck to the hole on their left.
* [[Broomball]] is played on an ice hockey rink, but with a ball instead of a puck and a "broom" (actually a stick with a small plastic implement on the end) in place of the ice hockey stick. Instead of skates, special shoes are used that have very soft rubbery soles to maximize grip while running around.
* [[Deck hockey]] is traditionally played by the [[Royal Navy]] on ships' decks, using short wooden L-shaped sticks.
* [[Floor hockey]] is a form of hockey played on foot, on a flat, smooth floor surface, usually indoors in gymnasiums or similar spaces.
* [[Floorball]] is a form of hockey played in a gymnasium or in a sports hall. A [[whiffle ball]] is used instead of a plastic ball, and the sticks are only one meter long and made from composite materials.
* [[Foot hockey]] or sock hockey is played using a bald tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks and using only the feet.  It is popular in elementary schools in the winter.
* Genna<ref name=genna>{{cite news|url=http://hockeygods.com/hockeys/47-The_Game_of_Ganna___G__nna___isganna|title=THE GAME OF GANNA|date=March 10, 2019|work=[[Hockey Gods]]|accessdate=2019-03-10}}</ref> is a field hockey sport played in Ethiopia, with which the Ethiopian Christmas festival shares its name. The equipment consists of a strong stick curved at one end, and a ball of two kinds: either called srur (made out of a rounded piece of hard-wood) or tsng (made by weaving a long strip of leather into a rounded shape).
* Gym hockey is a form of ice hockey played in a gymnasium. It uses sticks with foam ends and a foam ball or a plastic puck.
* [[Hurling]] and [[Camogie]] are [[Ireland|Irish]] games bearing some resemblance to – and notable differences from – hockey.
* [[Indoor hockey]] is an indoor variation of field hockey.
* [[Mini hockey]] (or knee-hockey), also known as "mini-sticks" is a form of hockey played in the United States in the basements of houses. Players kneel and use a miniature plastic stick, usually about 15&nbsp;inches (38&nbsp;cm) long, to manoeuvre a small ball or a soft, fabric-covered mini puck into miniature goals.  In England 'mini hockey' refers to a seven-a-side version of field hockey for younger players, played on an area equivalent to half a normal pitch.
* [[Nok Hockey]] is a table-top version of hockey played with no defence and a small block in front of the goal.
* [[Pond hockey]] is a simplified form of ice hockey played on naturally frozen ice.
* [[Power hockey]] is a form of hockey for persons requiring the use of an electric (power) wheelchair in daily life.
* [[Ringette]] is an ice hockey variant that was designed for female players; it uses a straight stick and a rubber ring in place of a puck. The rules differ from those of hockey and resemble a mix of lacrosse and basketball.
* [[Rink bandy]] and [[rinkball]] are team sports of Scandinavian origin that are played like bandy but on an ice hockey rink and with fewer players on each team.
* [[Rossall hockey]] is a variation played at [[Rossall School]] on the sea shore in the winter months. Its rules are a mix of field hockey, [[Rugby football|rugby]] and the [[Eton wall game]].
* [[Shinny]] is an informal version of ice hockey.
* [[Shinty]] is a Scottish game now played primarily in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]
* [[Skater hockey]] is a variant of inline hockey, played with a ball.
* [[Spongee]] is a cross between ice hockey and broomball and is most popular in [[Manitoba]], Canada. A stick and puck are used as in hockey (the puck is a softer version called a "sponge puck"), and the same soft-soled shoes are worn as in broomball. The rules are basically the same as for ice hockey, but one variation has an extra player on the ice called a "rover".
* [[Table hockey games|Table hockey]] is played indoors on a table.
* [[Underwater hockey]] is played on the bottom of a swimming pool.
* [[Unicycle hockey]] is played on a hard surface using unicycles as the method of player movement. There is generally no dedicated goalkeeper.
