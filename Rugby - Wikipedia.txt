Legend claims that rugby football was started about 1845 in [[Rugby School]], [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], England, although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times. Rugby eventually split into two sports in 1895 when twenty-one [[amateur sports|amateur]] clubs split from the original [[Rugby Football Union]], to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU)/Northern Union]] (later to be named rugby league in 1922) in the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|George Hotel]], [[Huddersfield]], Northern England over broken-time payments to players who took time off work to play the sport, thus making rugby league the first code to turn [[professional sport|professional]] and pay players it was 100 years later in 1995, following the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in South Africa that rugby union would turn fully professional.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/02/broken-time-review |title=Broken Time -review |publisher=The Guardian |date=2 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://moneyweek.com/405912/27-august-1995-rugby-union-turns-professional/ |title=27 August 1995:Rugby Union turns professional |publisher=MoneyWeek |date=27 August 2015}}</ref> Both sports are run by their respective world governing bodies [[World Rugby]] (rugby union) and the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (rugby league). Rugby football was one of many versions of [[football]] played at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|English public schools]] in the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm Rugby Football History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/Schism.html Rugby Football History Schism]</ref> Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. In addition to these two codes, both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]] evolved from rugby football.

{{See also|Comparison of rugby league and rugby union}}
Following the 1895 split in rugby football, the two forms [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] differed in administration only. Soon the rules of rugby league were modified, resulting in two distinctly different forms of rugby. After 100 years, in 1995 rugby union joined rugby league and most other forms of football as an openly [[professional sports|professional sport]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Ian|title=The bluffer's guide|url=http://w[[The Age]]|date=10 October 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715160210/http://w/|archivedate=15 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Olympic form of rugby is known as Rugby 7s. In this form of the game, each team has 7 players on the field at one time playing 7 minute halves. The rules and pitch size are the same as rugby union.

In 1871, English clubs met to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). In 1892, after charges of professionalism (compensation of team members) were made against some clubs for paying players for missing work, the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]], usually called the Northern Union (NU), was formed.<ref>{{cite news | last =Baker | first =Andrew | coauthors = | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era | newspaper = [[The Independent]]| pages = | publisher =independent.co.uk | date =20 August 1995 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html | accessdate =25 September 2009 }}</ref> The existing rugby union authorities responded by issuing sanctions against the clubs, players, and officials involved in the new organization.

|-
| 1861 || The [[Montevideo Cricket Club]] is founded in Montevideo, Uruguay. The first club to play rugby outside the British Islands.
|-
| 1863 || [[The Football Association]] (FA) is formed, formalising the schism between [[association football]] and rugby football.
|-
| 1864 || The first rugby clubs are formed, followed by hundreds more in Cumberland, Lancashire and Yorkshire in the 1870s, and 1880s.
|-
| 1865 || The British Army plays a game of rugby against civilians in Montreal, introducing rugby to the country. This movement would later evolve into [[Canadian football]].
|-
| 1871 || The [[Rugby Football Union]] is founded, following a meeting of 25 clubs at the Pall Mall restaurant.
|-
| 1871 || [[1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match|First recognised international rugby match]], played between England and Scotland.
|-
| 1876 || [[Matthew Bloxam]]'s letter is published in ''The Meteor''. It claims [[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, picked up the ball and invented rugby. Although a Rugby Football Union inquiry in 1895 found no actual proof, it decided to perpetuate the myth.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
|-
| 1877 || The number of players is reduced from 20 to 15 a side.
|-
| 1880 || English Rugby rules required for a tackled player, when the ball was "fairly held", to put the ball down immediately for scrummage. 
[[Walter Camp]] proposed at the US [[College Football]] 1880 rules convention that the contested [[Scrum (rugby)|scrummage]] be replaced with a "[[line of scrimmage]]" where the team with the ball started with uncontested possession. This change effectively started the evolution of the modern game of [[History of American Football|American football]] away from its rugby origins. 
|-
| 1883 || [[1883 Home Nations Championship|First]] [[Six Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]] between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
|-
| 1886 || Concerned at the growing dominance of the largely working-class northern clubs, the Rugby Football Union introduces strict amateur rules: no one was allowed to seek or receive payment or other material reward for taking part in the game.
|-
| 1888 || [[1888–1889 New Zealand Native football team|New Zealand Native football team tours Britain, Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889]].
|-
| 1890 || Modern points scoring is uniformly accepted by the Home Nations for the 1890–91 season.
|-
| 1892 || Charges of professionalism are laid against rugby football clubs in Bradford and Leeds, after they compensated players for missing work. This was despite the fact that the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid, such as the [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1888 British Isles team that toured Australasia]], and the account of [[Harry Hamill]] of his payments to represent New South Wales (NSW) against England in 1904.
|-
| 1893 || Yorkshire clubs propose allowing players to be paid six shillings ‘broken-time’ payments when they miss work due to matches. RFU votes down proposal. Widespread suspensions of northern clubs and players begin.
|-
| 1895 || [[History of rugby league|The Schism]] in rugby football results in the formation of the [[Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). Many factors played a part in the split, including the success of working class northern teams, a decree  by the RFU banning the playing of rugby at grounds where entrance fees were charged, threat of expulsion from the RFU if clubs cannot prove their amateurism, and the banning of "broken time payments" to players who had taken time off work to play rugby. Twenty-two clubs met at the George Hotel, Huddersfield and formed the "Northern Rugby Football Union". Within fifteen years of that first meeting in Huddersfield, more than 200 RFU clubs had left to join the Northern Union.
|-
| 1897 || To make the game more exciting, the Northern Union abolishes the line-out and reduces value of all goals to two points. Line outs were replaced with punting the ball back into play from the touch-line. Tries worth three points.
|-
| 1897 || The [[Challenge Cup]] is established and proves a success from the start. [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] became the first winners, beating [[St Helens R.F.C.|Saint Helens]] 10–3.
|-
| 1898 || Professionalism is introduced in the Northern Union. The professionalism is strictly part-time, with players obliged to have other "proper" jobs.
|-

|-
| 1901 || The experiment in the Northern Union with the punt-out ends after only four years. In future, play will be restarted with a scrum after the ball goes out of play

|-

|-
| 1906 || England play South Africa (known as the [[Springboks]]) in rugby union for the first time. [[James Peters (rugby)|James Peters]] is withdrawn from the England squad after the South Africans objected to playing against a black player.
|-
| 1906 ||  James Peters becomes the first black person to play rugby union for England, against Scotland.
|-
| 1906 || In the Northern Union the number of players is reduced from fifteen to thirteen a side, in order to allow more room for creative play. The early form of play-the-ball is introduced as the game's way of restarting play after a tackle.
|-
| 1907 || [[1907–1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain|A New Zealand professional rugby team tours Britain]]. [[Albert Henry Baskerville]], a Post Office clerk in New Zealand, organises a touring side branded the ‘All Golds’ in Sydney due to the players receiving a share of any profits from the tour. They play under rugby union rules in Sydney. On their way to Britain, Australia's greatest player, [[Dally Messenger]], joins them on tour. They win the game's first test series 2–1, but Baskerville dies of pneumonia on the way home at the age of 25.
|-
| 1907 || Rugby league spreads to Australia and New Zealand. The [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] is founded at Bateman's Hotel in Sydney. The New South Wales Rugby League sets up an eight-team competition after a row with the [[New South Wales Rugby Union]] over compensation for injured players. The first Premiership is won by [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]]. Rugby league goes on to displace rugby union as the primary football code in New South Wales and Queensland.

[[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] become the first club to win all four trophies available to them; the Championship, the Challenge Cup, the Yorkshire Cup and the Yorkshire League.

The code's funds and property are all confiscated or passed to rugby union clubs. Rugby union is allowed to carry on unscathed and regains much of the ground it had lost to rugby league. To this day, the rugby league clubs' assets have never been returned to them.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Global status of rugby codes==
[[Rugby union]] is both a professional and amateur game, and is dominated by the first tier unions:  [[Rugby union in New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Rugby union in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Rugby union in Wales|Wales]], [[Rugby union in England|England]], [[Rugby union in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Rugby union in Australia|Australia]], [[Rugby union in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Rugby union in Scotland|Scotland]], [[Rugby union in Italy|Italy ]] and [[Rugby union in France|France]]. Second and third tier unions include [[Rugby union in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Rugby union in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Rugby union in Canada|Canada]], [[Rugby union in Chile|Chile]], [[Rugby union in Fiji|Fiji]], [[Rugby union in Georgia|Georgia]], [[Rugby union in Germany|Germany]], [[Rugby union in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Rugby union in Japan|Japan]], [[Rugby union in Kenya|Kenya]], [[Rugby union in Namibia|Namibia]], [[Rugby union in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Rugby union in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Rugby union in Romania|Romania]], [[Rugby union in Russia|Russia]], [[Rugby union in Samoa|Samoa]], [[Rugby union in Spain|Spain]], [[Rugby union in Tonga|Tonga]], [[Rugby union in the United States|the United States]] and [[Rugby union in Uruguay|Uruguay]]. Rugby Union is administered by [[World Rugby]] (WR), whose headquarters are located in [[Dublin]], Ireland. It is the [[national sport]] in New Zealand, Wales, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Georgia and [[Rugby union in Madagascar|Madagascar]], and is the most popular form of rugby globally.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kemp |first=Stuart |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2437023820070826 |title=Rugby World Cup gaining wide popularity |agency=Reuters   |accessdate=30 May 2011 |date=24 August 2007}}</ref> The Olympic Games have admitted the seven-a-side version of the game, known as [[Rugby sevens]], into the programme from Rio de Janeiro in 2016 onwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/news/newsid=2035087.html#olympics+sevens+heaven+rugby |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103082612/http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/news/newsid=2035087.html#olympics+sevens+heaven+rugby |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 January 2010 |title=International Rugby Board – News |publisher=Irb.com |accessdate=30 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There was a possibility sevens would be a demonstration sport at the [[2012 London Olympics]] but many sports including sevens were dropped.<ref name=SportsDropped>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2005-07-08-baseball-softball-dropped_x.htm |title=Baseball, softball bumped from Olympics |first=Vicki |last=Michaelis |accessdate=17 August 2008 |date=8 July 2005 |work=USA Today }}</ref>

In Canada and the United States, rugby union evolved into [[gridiron football]]. During the late 1800s (and even the early 1900s), the two forms of the game were very similar (to the point where the United States was able to win the gold medal for [[rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]), but numerous rule changes have differentiated the gridiron-based game from its rugby counterpart, introduced by [[Walter Camp]] in the United States and [[John Thrift Meldrum Burnside]] in Canada. Among unique features of the North American game are the separation of play into [[down (American football)|downs]] instead of releasing the ball immediately upon tackling, the requirement that the team with the ball set into a [[formation (American football)|set formation]] for at least one second before [[snap (football)|resuming play after a tackle]] (and the allowance of up to 40 seconds to do so), the allowance for one [[forward pass]] from behind the site of the last tackle on each down, the evolution of hard plastic equipment (particularly the [[football helmet]] and [[shoulder pads]]), a smaller and pointier ball that is favorable to being passed but makes [[drop kick]]s impractical, a generally smaller and narrower field measured in customary units instead of metric (in [[Indoor American football|some variants of the American game]] a field can be as short as 50 yards between end zones), and a distinctive field (shaped like a gridiron, from which the code's nickname is derived) with lines marked in five-yard intervals.

[[Rugby league]] is also both a professional and amateur game, administered on a global level by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. In addition to amateur and semi-professional competitions in the [[Rugby league in the United States|United States]], [[Rugby league in Russia|Russia]], [[Rugby league in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Rugby league in Serbia|Serbia]], Europe and Australasia, there are two major professional competitions—the Australasian [[National Rugby League]] and the [[Super League]]. International Rugby League is dominated by [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]], [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. In [[Rugby league in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] it is the [[national sport]].<ref name="PNG vow to upset World Cup odds">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_league/7671217.stm|title=PNG vow to upset World Cup odds|date=15 October 2008|work=Rugby League|publisher=Federación Peruana de Frontón|accessdate=3 July 2009|quote=But it would still be one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history if Papua New Guinea – ''the only country to have rugby league as its national sport'' – were to qualify for the last four.}}</ref><ref name="PNG seal 2010 Four Nations place">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/8336567.stm|title=PNG seal 2010 Four Nations place|publisher=BBC|date=1 November 2009}}</ref>  Other nations from the South Pacific and Europe also play in the [[Rugby League Pacific Cup|Pacific Cup]] and [[Rugby League European Cup|European Cup]] respectively.

[[File:Rugby Lineout.jpg|thumb|A rugby lineout being conducted. A group from either team lifts a player to fight and catch the ball for their team. (OSUWRC 2014)]]
[[File:Scrum-1.JPG|thumb|[[Rugby union]]: A [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] between the [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] and the [[Brumbies]] (May 2006)]]
Distinctive features common to both rugby codes include the oval [[rugby ball|ball]] and throwing the ball forward is not allowed so that players can gain ground only by running with the ball or by kicking it. As the sport of rugby league moved further away from its union counterpart, rule changes were implemented with the aim of making a faster-paced and more try-oriented game. Another interesting fact about rugby is that, unlike football, the players do not wear any sort of protection or armour.

The main differences between the two games, besides league having teams of 13 players and union of 15, involve the [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] and its aftermath:
* Union players contest possession following the tackle: depending on the situation, either a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] or a [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]] can occur. League players may not contest possession after making a tackle: play is continued with a ''[[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play-the-ball]]''.
* In league, if the team in possession fails to score before a set of six tackles, it surrenders possession. Union has no six-tackle rule; a team can keep the ball for an unlimited number of tackles before scoring as long as it maintains possession and does not commit an offence.

[[set piece (football)|Set pieces]] of the union code include the "[[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]]", which occurs after a minor infringement of the rules (most often a knock-on, when a player knocks the ball forward), where packs of opposing players push against each other for possession, and the "[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]", in which parallel lines of players from each team, arranged perpendicular to the [[touch-line]], attempt to catch the ball thrown from [[touch (rugby)|touch]]. A rule has been added to line-outs which allows the jumper to be pulled down once a players' feet are on the ground.

In the league code, the scrum still exists, but with greatly reduced importance as it involves fewer players and is rarely contested. Set pieces are generally started from the play-the-ball situation. Many of the [[rugby league positions]] have similar names and requirements to [[rugby union positions]], but there are no [[Flanker (rugby union)|flankers]] in rugby league.

==Culture==

===Home countries===
In England, [[rugby union]] is widely regarded as an "establishment" sport, played mostly by members of the [[upper classes|upper]] and [[middle classes]]. For example, many pupils at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s and [[grammar school]]s play rugby union, although the game (which had a long history of being played at [[state school]]s until the 1980s) is becoming increasingly popular in [[comprehensive school]]s.<ref>Phillips, Buchler. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmcumeds/99/99ap22.htm Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence to Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport]</ref> Despite this stereotype, the game, particularly in the [[West Country]] is popular amongst all classes. In contrast, [[rugby league]] has traditionally been seen as a working-class pursuit. Another exception to rugby union's upper-class stereotype is in Wales, where it has been traditionally associated with small village teams made up of coal miners and other industrial workers who played on their days off.<ref>Sommerville, D. (1997). The Encyclopedia of Rugby Union. Aurum Press, UK. {{ISBN|1-85410-481-0}}.</ref> In [[Ireland]], both rugby union and rugby league are unifying forces across the national and sectarian divide, with the Ireland international teams representing both political entities.

In Australia, support for both codes is concentrated in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at private schools.<ref name="Collins Paper">Collins, T. (2005). "Australian Nationalism and Working-Class Britishness: The Case of Rugby League Football." History Compass, Vol. 3, No. 1.</ref>

Exceptions to the above include New Zealand (although rugby league is still considered to be a lower class game by many or a game for 'westies' referring to lower class western suburbs of Auckland and more recently, southern Auckland where the game is also popular), Wales, France (except Paris), [[Cornwall]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Somerset]], [[Scottish Borders]], [[County Limerick]] (see [[Munster Rugby|Munster]]) and the [[Pacific Islands]], where rugby union is popular in working class communities. Nevertheless, rugby league is perceived as the game of the working-class people in [[northern England]]<ref>Collins, T. (1998). Rugby’s Great Split: Class, Culture and the Origins of Rugby League Football (London).</ref> and in the [[Australian states]] of [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]].<ref name="Collins Paper" />

In the United Kingdom, rugby union fans sometimes used the term "rugger" as an alternative name for the sport, (see [[Oxford '-er']]), although this archaic expression has not had currency since the 1950s or earlier.<ref>Rugger:
* [[OED]]: Rugger "Slang or colloquial alteration of RUGBY (in the sense of 'Rugby football'). Freq. attrib. rugger-tackle".
* Tony Collins, ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/recordings/individual/leeds-leeds-collins-tony.shtml Football, rugby, rugger?]'', BBC sound recording with written transcript, and a comment in prose by Jonnie Robinson, Curator, English accents and dialects, British Library Sound Archive.</ref> New Zealanders refer to rugby union simply as either "rugby" or "union", or even simply "football", and to rugby league as "rugby league" or "league".<ref>The New Zealand Pocket Oxford Dictionary. {{ISBN|0-19-558379-5}}.</ref> In the U.S., people who play rugby are sometimes called "ruggers", a term little used elsewhere except facetiously.

===Internationally===
In [[France]], rugby is widely played and has a strong tradition in the [[Basque people|Basque]], [[Occitania|Occitan]] and [[Catalan people|Catalan]] areas along the border regions between Spain and France. The game is very popular in South Africa, having been introduced by English-speaking settlers in the 19th century. British colonists also brought the game with them to Australia and New Zealand, where the game is widely played. It has spread thence to much of Polynesia, having particularly strong followings in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Rugby union continues to grow in the Americas and parts of Asia as well.

==Injuries==
About a quarter of rugby players are injured in each season.  [https://physioworks.com.au/Injuries-Conditions/Activities/rugby-union-injuries]

==Rugby ball==
[[File:Rugbyball2.jpg|thumb|A [[Gilbert (sports equipment)|Gilbert]] rugby football as used in [[rugby union]]]]

A [[rugby ball]], originally called a quanco, is a diamond shape ball used for easier passing.
Richard Lindon and Bernardo Solano started making balls for Rugby school out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pigs’ bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig's bladder, although early balls were more plumb-shape than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig's bladder was.

In rugby union, World Rugby regulates the size and shape of the ball under Law 2 (also known as Law E.R.B); an official rugby union ball is oval and made of four panels, has a length in-line of 280–300 millimetres, a circumference (end to end) of 740–770 millimetres, and a circumference (in width) of 580–620 millimetres. It is made of leather or suitable synthetic material and may be treated to make it [[Waterproofing|water resistant]] and easier to grip. The rugby ball may not weigh more than 460&nbsp;grams or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71–68.75 [[Pascal (unit)|kilopascals]], or 0.67–0.70 kilograms per square centimetre, or 9.5–10.0&nbsp;lbs per square inch.<ref>International rugby board. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120417010050/http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/IRB_Laws_2012_EN.pdf "Rugby ball laws"] 22 Feb. 2010.</ref> Spare balls are allowed under the condition that players or teams do not seek an advantage by changing the ball. Smaller sized balls may also be used in games between younger players.
Much larger versions of traditional balls are also available for purchase, but these are mainly for their novelty attraction.

==World Cups==
The [[Rugby World Cup]], which was first held in New Zealand and Australia in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]], occurs every four years.  It is an international tournament organized by [[World Rugby]]. The event is played in the union format and features the top 20 teams from around the world. The current world champions are New Zealand, who won the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]], which was played in England.

The [[Rugby League World Cup]] was the first World Cup of either of the Rugby codes and was first held in France in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], and as of 2013 occurs on a 4-year cycle. It is an international tournament that is organized by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. The event is played in the league format and features the top 14 teams from around the world. The current world champions are Australia, who won the World Cup in [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013]], played in England, Wales, France, and Ireland.

==Rugby shirt==
{{see also|Rugby union numbering schemes}}
[[Rugby shirt]]s were formerly made of cotton but are now made of a cotton and polyester mix. This material has the advantage of not absorbing as much water or mud as cotton alone.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Owing to the more aggressive nature of the game, rugby clothing, in general, is designed to be much more robust and hardwearing than that worn for association football.

The rugby jerseys are slightly different depending on the type of rugby game played. The shirts worn by [[rugby league]] footballers commonly have a large "V" around the neck. The players in rugby union wear jerseys with a more traditional design, sometimes completely white ([[Cahors Rugby]] in France). The number of the player and his or her surname are placed on the upper back of the jersey (often name above number, with the number being significantly larger and more central), and the logo of the team on the upper left chest.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Rugby betting==
{{See also|Sports betting}}
With the popularity of rugby over the years, many betting establishments have made it possible for viewers of the game to place wagers on games.  The various types of wagers that can be placed on games vary, however, the main types of bets that can be placed are as follows:
* Fixed-odds betting
* Futures/Outright Bets
* Prop Bets / Specials
* Over/Under Bets

Like most team sports, both forms of rugby are vulnerable to match-fixing, particularly bets involving easily manipulated outcomes, such as conceding penalties and first point scorer. A recent example is a deliberate infringement by [[Ryan Tandy]] in order for the first points scored to be a penalty goal in a 2010 NRL match; the attempt backfired when instead of taking a shot at goal, a try was scored.
